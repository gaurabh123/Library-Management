# Library-Management-System
Here I have created a library management system with python. Here all the details of book inside the library is handled in the text files. We have stock file that contains the collection of books, their name, author's name, quantity etc. I have attached a screen recorded video of the code by running it in vscode, this will give you better understanding of how the project works.
